## 🚦 Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

See [deployment notes](deployment.md) on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### 🔑 Prerequisites

Set up your development environment for building, running, and testing the Standup Raven.

#### 👨‍💻 Obtaining Source

    $ git clone git@github.com:standup-raven/standup-raven.git

#### Go

Requires go version 1.18

    https://golang.org/doc/install
    
#### NodeJS

Recommended NodeJS version 14.8.0

    https://nodejs.org/download/release/v14.8.0/

#### Make

On Ubuntu -

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
    
On MacOS, install XCode command line tools. 

#### HTTPie

You need this only if you want to use `$ make deploy` for deployments to Mattermost instances.

On MacOS

    $ brew install httpie

### 👨‍💻 Building

Once you have fetched the repo, simply run `$ make dist` from the repo.

This will produce three artifacts in `/dist` directory -

| MacOS   | `mattermost-plugin-standup-raven-vx.y.z-darwin-amd64.tar.gz` |
| Windows | `mattermost-plugin-standup-raven-vx.y.z-windows-amd64.tar.gz`|

This will also install, Glide - the Go package manager.
